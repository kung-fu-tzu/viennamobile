# viennamobile
Light Jiggy based application for offline reading RSS messages downloaded by desktop Vienna. Now we are working on seamless synchronization with it ;)

Put your Vienna messages.db (from ~/Library/Application Support/Vienna) to iphone's /var/mobile/Library/ViennaMobile. And if you want to see icons copy them from Vienna's /Images folder to ViennaMobile library /icons. This is a temporary solution until we make sync task ;)
